# CSIRL (Counter Strike In Real Life)
CSIRL is meant to be played as a real life version of Counter Strike. This game is played by two teams using Nerf, Laser Tag, or similar weapons. Best played in a large building or outdoor area.

This game only focuses on DE style maps, Bomb Defusal & Arsenal Demolition. As such the game includes a virtual reality bomb that must be planted in a target zone. Once armed/planted by the terrorist team, the bomb can be defused by the counter terrorist team to win. The game also allows for bomb drop/pickup (person holding the bomb is killed), as well a win in the event of the entire team is killed before a bomb is planted.

This game is meant to be played on mobile devices, where one of the devices is the "bomb". The players will all be on the same screen that displays the bomb, however an additional device should be utilized as the true one "bomb". We recommend an iPad or Android tablet in a sturdy case (it will get dropped, a lot).

*PLEASE NOTE* - This game requires a back end running for real time communication between players. Simply running this repo will not do it. See the back end component in this GitHub Org for the complete game engine.
